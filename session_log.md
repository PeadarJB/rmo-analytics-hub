# RMO Pavement Condition Analytics Hub – Development Session Log

## Context
This project is building the **RMO Pavement Condition Analytics Hub**, a modern GIS web application for the Road Management Office (RMO).  
It replaces an existing Tableau workflow with an interactive, map-centric dashboard to visualize, compare, and report pavement condition metrics for Ireland’s regional road network.

### Key References
- **Core KPIs**: IRI, Rut Depth, PSCI, CSC, MPD, LPV3 (from 2018 Regional Report).
- **Architecture**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Ant Design + ArcGIS API for JS + Zustand state management.
- **Source Template**: TII Flood Risk Dashboard codebase, reused and adapted here.
- **Guidance Docs**: RMO Build Pack, Project Brief Summary, Development Plan, Wireframes.

## Work Completed in Session

### 1. Project Scaffolding
- Created a new Vite + TypeScript React app (`rmo-analytics-hub`).
- Replicated TII dashboard folder structure for scalability and consistency.
- Added `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `index.html`.

### 2. Core Layout
- Implemented `App.tsx` with Ant Design `Layout`: header, collapsible sider, map-first content area.
- Header includes panel toggles for **Filters, Stats, Charts, Swipe, Theme Mode**.
- Theme support added (light/dark tokens via `themeConfig.tsx`).

### 3. State Management
- Built Zustand `useAppStore.ts` with slices for:
  - **Map**: mapView, roadLayer, roadLayerSwipe.
  - **UI**: panel visibility, theme mode, sider collapse.
  - **Data**: activeKPI, currentFilters, currentStats.
- Actions: `initializeMap`, `applyFilters`, `calculateStatistics`, `enterSwipeMode`, etc.

### 4. Map Integration
- Implemented `MapViewService.ts` to initialize WebMap by ID.
- Added `MapWidgets.tsx` (Legend, LayerList, BasemapGallery).
- Placeholders used for WebMapId and layer names (to be filled with RMO data).

### 5. UI Panels
- **EnhancedFilterPanel.tsx**: AntD card with multi-selects for LA, Subgroup, Route, Year.
- **EnhancedStatsPanel.tsx**: Displays total segments/length + KPI summaries (avg, min, max, Good/Fair/Poor%).
- **EnhancedChartPanel.tsx**: Chart.js bar chart grouped by LA/Route/Year with AntD selector.
- **SimpleSwipePanel.tsx**: ArcGIS Swipe widget for year-to-year comparison.

### 6. Styling
- Added `styled.ts` (AntD-style utilities) for floating panel placement.
- Global LESS reset and AntD reset imported.

### 7. Packaging & Run
- Produced `rmo-analytics-hub.zip` deliverable with full scaffold.
- User installed dependencies and ran `npm run dev`, verified app served at `http://localhost:5173/`.
- Fixed install conflicts (`typescript-eslint`) and JSX parsing issue in `themeConfig.tsx`.

---

## Current Status
- App runs locally with AntD panels and ArcGIS map scaffold.
- Panels are interactive but connected to **placeholder ArcGIS queries and stats**.
- KPI field names, subgroup categories, WebMap ID remain placeholders until RMO data schema is connected.
- Vite upgraded to v7.1.3 to resolve `esbuild` vulnerability flagged by `npm audit`.

---

## Next Steps
- **Phase 2**: Implement dynamic class-break renderers for KPIs (using thresholds from 2018 Report).
- **Phase 3**: Wire filters → ArcGIS queries → stats/charts with live data.
- **Phase 4**: Extend Swipe panel for side-by-side year maps, add CSV/PDF reporting.
- **Phase 5**: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), performance tuning, end-to-end testing.

---

## Notes for Next Developer/LLM
- Update `src/config/appConfig.ts` with real **WebMap ID**, **layer titles**, and **field names** from the RMO ArcGIS services.
- Replace placeholder logic in `StatisticsService.ts` with real `outStatistics` queries.
- Verify subgroup codes and survey year values align with actual schema.
- Continue following the phased Development Plan to expand functionality.
